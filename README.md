## Mouse bindings
The mouse is used primarily in FSS and DSS modes.

***MOVE MOUSE*** - Aim

***LEFT BTN*** - Zoom in (FSS) / Fire probe (DSS)

***RIGHT BTN*** - Zoom out (FSS) / Toggle planet view (FSS)

***MIDDLE BTN*** - Exit mode

***SCROLL WHEEL*** - Stepped zoom (DSS)

For this to work without mapping conflicts, make sure your DSS is set to fire group 1.
